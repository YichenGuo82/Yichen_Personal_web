In order to develop a sufficient and efficient market breadth measurement model, I'm going to collect the daily change of each ticker within the S&P 500 from the past, which the data source I'm going to be using is the Yahoo Finance, which I believe will give me the needed data and insights for market breadth cacluation.

Yahoo Finance is a popular financial website that provides access to a wide range of financial information, including stock market data. It is a comprehensive platform that offers real-time quotes, financial news, and investment tools for individuals and professionals. In the context of this project, we can use Yahoo Finance to obtain historical data for all stocks in the S&P 500 index. This data includes the opening and closing prices for each stock on a daily basis. To access this information, we can simply search for the desired stock on the Yahoo Finance website and view its historical price data. This data can then be used to analyze market trends, calculate financial metrics, and develop a market breadth model.

## R quantmod package
